## The problem it solved
During this time of COVID'19,it is not possible for companies to have a physical recruitement drives in various Universities.
So,we have developed a platform to help the recruiters to get in touch with students remotely.
This platform is useful,even for those companies,which recruit employess from various parts of the world.

We have added new ways to structure our interview. We have added real-time notepad and scoring features on our platform. Live notepad makes a smooth understanding between candidate and interviewer while discussing the problems. We also developed a resume filter built using Natural Language Processing. It filters out the candidates on the basis of their skills and thus makes the interview process less hectic and more effective.

## Challenges we ran into

There were two challenges that we faced in this 32 hour long hackathon.

* We have faced problem while extracting the text from the resume pdf. In the beginning, we have used **PyPDF2** module to extract the text from pdf but it was only able to read **"\n"** from the pdf and thus we are not getting desire output. We have fixed this issue by using the **tika** module of python.
Also, the resume filter is only able to extract the data and filters the candidate on the basis of their skills. Due to time constraints, we are not able to extract all the details like name, emails, etc from the resume itself.
* The mailing system works from a given location only.As we used Gmail as our SMTP service,it doesn't allow sending mails from two different locations.
