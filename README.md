# Recruitify

## About
Recruitify is a web application interview platform optimized for taking online interviews. We are exploring new ways to structure our interview process to create familiarity for candidates and account for bias, resulting in better candidate experience and hiring decisions.

## Product Features

## Hiring Process
The process of hiring is a fixed sequence of steps. The following steps are available:

* application for the vacancy by the applicant
* smart-filter â€” filter the candidate on the basis of the number of skills he/she has.
* video interviews
* score
* save performance of the candidate into the database.

## The problem it solved
We have added new ways to structure our interview. We have added real-time notepad and scoring features on our platform. Live notepad makes a smooth understanding between candidate and interviewer while discussing the problems. Also, we are using a resume filter built using Natural Language Processing. It filters out the candidates on the basis of their skills and thus makes the interview process less hectic.

## Challenges we ran into
Our resume filter is only able to extract the data and filters the candidate on the basis of their skills. Due to time constraints, we are not able to extract all the details like name, emails, etc from the resume itself.
